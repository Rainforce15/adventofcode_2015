Advent of Code - 2015
=====================

trying to codegolf all of Advent of Code with Javascript/Node.js.

check http://adventofcode.com for more info.

run with
`node solve.js [puzzle number]`

where puzzle number is the day plus the a or b variant of the puzzle, e.g. `node solve.js 6a`, `node solve.js 24b`

data is then taken from the input folder, e.g. `input/6.txt`, `input/24.txt`

currently, this is a work in progress - once done, there will be a standard and a golf variant.
